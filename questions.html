			<h2>#1 Don't ask to ask</h2>
			<p>Do not start your conversation with “May I ask a question?” or “Can anyone help me?”<br>
				Although that may be polite in normal human interaction, it does not work that way on Discord. Just ask
				your question.</p>
			<h2>#2 Be precise</h2>
			<p>Include as much detail as possible.
				This includes the server you experienced the issue on and the date that it occurred. Your timezone can
				also be helpful, as many developers are internationally located.</p>
			<h2>#3 Include the code</h2>
			<p>If you're asking about code, take a screenshot or use a pastebin.<br>
				However you do it, include the snippet - we're only going to have to ask you anyway.</p>
			<h3>#3a Use a pastebin</h3>
			<p>Please don't try to paste an entire DM file into chat, it won't help anyone.
				Here is one you can use: <a href="https://bin.file.house">https://bin.file.house</a></p>
			<h3>#3b Include full errors</h3>
			<p>If you're getting an error, put it in a pastebin.
				The full error will give us more info to help you debug what went wrong.</p>
			<h2>#4 Explain what you're trying to achieve</h2>
			<p>This way we can tell you if what you're currently doing makes sense, or if you'd have to do something
				else anyways.<br>
				This is much better rather than spending ages helping you only for us both to find out it won't help you
				at all</p>
			<h2>#5 Don't ping specific people</h2>
			<p>Use a role ping if it's urgent, otherwise just put your question out with no pings.<br>
				People are more likely to respond if you don't ask a specific person as they won't feel like they're
				stepping on someone elses toes.<br>
				Furthermore, there are likely specialists with regard to the topic that you don't know about who will
				reveal themselves by responding.</p>
			<h2>#6 Read the byond ref</h2>
			<p>People are less likely to help you if you are asking questions that are answerable by the byond
				reference, <a href="https://secure.byond.com/docs/ref/index.html#/DM">go read it now</a></p>
			<h2>#7 Wait for the answers</h2>
			<p>An answer might arrive now, or it might arrive in the next day. Be patient and wait a few hours before
				asking again. Discord has async chat, and people can answer when you're offline and they come online</p>
			<h2>#8 Answer questions in a timely fashion</h2>
			<p> If someone asks you a question, try to answer it as soon as you can, otherwise let them know you if you
				cant or you don't know how, this will help us help you</p>
